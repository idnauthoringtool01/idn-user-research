# Supplementary Materials – AI-Supported IDN Authoring Tool

This repository contains supplementary materials for a research artefact exploring how varying levels of structure and AI support impact the authoring process in Interactive Digital Narratives (IDN). The artefact consists of three interconnected modules: Setup, Scene Creation, and Knowledge Graph. Each module includes multiple design variants evaluated through usability testing sessions.

## 2. Artefact Overview

This repository includes screenshots and interactive prototypes of the AI-supported authoring tool, organized by module and interface version. Each version was designed to explore different authoring workflows and levels of AI assistance.

### Setup Module

Supports the ideation phase, where authors define key narrative concepts.

- **Version A – Minimal Structure, No AI**  
  → Screenshots: `2-Artefact-Screenshots/Setup/Version-A/`

- **Version B – Light Structure with Passive AI Support**   
  → Screenshots: `2-Artefact-Screenshots/Setup/Version-B/`

- **Version C – High Structure with Active AI Feedback**    
  → **Live prototype**: https://v0-building-ui-for-paper-hoangnnp01-1670s-projects.vercel.app/ 

###  Scene Creation Module

- **Version A – Open Scene Writing**  
  Flexible editor with manual branching.  
  → Screenshots: `2-Artefact-Screenshots/Scene-Creation/Version-A/`

- **Version B – Template-Based with AI Suggestions**  
  Modular scene blocks with optional AI prompts.  
  → Screenshots: `2-Artefact-Screenshots/Scene-Creation/Version-B/`

### Knowledge Graph Module
 
  → **Live prototype**: https://v0-building-ui-for-paper-hoangnnp01-1670s-projects.vercel.app/
